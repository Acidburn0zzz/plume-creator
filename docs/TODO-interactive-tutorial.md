NOTE: I really like that [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) ships with an interactive tutorial. I think it's awesome, in fact, and I can't see any real reason why Plume can't. These things are fantastic introductions to the software and sometimes show off some stuff you may not easily find in the user manual.

Create a Plume document inside the current version of Plume - the DEVEL release - and use it to orient a new user and showoff all the cool features; possibly even suggest a workflow.
