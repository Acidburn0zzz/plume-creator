## PLUME CREATOR IS EDITOR OF CHOICE
The editor of choice will always be the most recent STABLE or RELEASE version of Plume unless that proves to unsuitable for use with git. Currently, this means legacy [version 0.66.1](http://sourceforge.net/projects/plume-creator/), available at Sourceforge.


## CONTRIBUTING
If you choose to contribute, be certain to use the same version of the editor to keep filetype in a working state.

Alternatively, contribute a Markdown file and immediately open a new issue requestiong inclusion of your documentation. Be sure to tag **@ParaplegicRacehorse** both in your pull request and in the new issue filed.

If managing the documentation via git, utilizing Plume, becomes untennable a switch to some markup language, such as Markdown or ReST may be in order. That will require some discussion and an issue will be filed in such an event.
