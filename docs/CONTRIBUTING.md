The plan, unless @jacquetc objects, is to create three separate manuals.

## CONTRIBUTING
Currently, the user manual is being written in [GitHub flavored Markdown][1]. Other lightweight markup formats offer a differing set of advantages and disadvantages. There is a quiet conversation about what to finally settle on.

The interactive tutorial will be written with Plume Creator, preferably the development version so the guide can be correct at release. This will result in a standard Plume project file which the new user can open and edit. The idea is, basically, to hand-hold the new user through learning how to use the program to best advantage. It will show off all the basic features and, hopefully, showcase any hidden gems which set it off from other, similar products and projects.

The coding manual should have some standards to follow both when hacking directly on Plume code and also when creating Plume plugins. Of course, it will have any needful references (API, which files are responsible for what, etc) included. Much of this should be auto-generated at compile time.

See the TODO-* files to monitor status, check the roadmap, or find out where your input might be most valuable. If the roadmap does not currently list something you think should be there, you can add it to the appropriate TODO file or file an issue flagged *Documentation*. It would be best if you added it to the TODO, filed and issue, AND did the work. :smiley:

Please be sure to update the CHANGELOG.md file when you make changes. This can all be seen via commit history, but it is really more convenient to just open the CHANGELOG.
