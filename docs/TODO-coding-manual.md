This will pretty much have to written by @jacquetc and the coding team.

- [ ] API reference, if any
- [ ] `doc.plume` file type reference
- [ ] code formatting standards

I understand the technical stuff is being autocreated by [Sphynx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) - that would be the API reference and maybe the file type reference. The output easily goes to RTD (HTML) or wherever, but can it be ouput to PDF and/or epub as well? If not, those formats may need to be hand-massaged. I can do the massage work, but I think a section on coding standards should be included and that's beyond my skill set.
