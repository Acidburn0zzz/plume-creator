# plume-creator
Software for writers

This software is the continuation of Plume Creator from http://sourceforge.net/projects/plume-creator/

The main change is the coding language : python 3.4 / PyQt5 instead of the c++ / Qt5 of the original software.

To avoid confusion with version numbers, this new Plume will start at version 1.5.0 . To point out the sofware is still under development, all releases will be tagged "alpha" until the 2.0 release.

Of course, the projects from the old Plume will be importable.

Help in testing or coding is always welcome! See CONTRIBUTING.md to learn how.
